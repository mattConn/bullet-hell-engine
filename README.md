# Bullet Hell Engine
Making a bullet hell/shmup engine with SDL2.

This project depends on SDL2 and SDL2_image. I followed along with Lazy Foo's tutorial to get started.

## Compiling
On Mac and Linux, use the makefile in `sdl-game`.

On Windows, open the solution file in the top-level directory with Visual Studio.
